End-to-end SaaS Churn Analysis and Retention Strategy using Machine Learning
# SaaS Churn Prediction and Strategic Retention Framework

## 📊 Project Overview

Customer retention is the lifeblood of SaaS businesses. In this real-world project, I build a complete workflow to predict customer churn, analyze its drivers, and translate model results into actionable business decisions—empowering any SaaS team to protect recurring revenue and grow customer loyalty.

- **Robust Predictive Modeling**: Random Forest and Logistic Regression models tuned for business action, with precision-recall curve for setting real-world risk thresholds.
- **Retention Strategy**: Concrete recommendations on where to focus customer success and marketing efforts—backed by interpretable model results.
- **Next Steps for Stakeholders**: Action plan for integrating churn alerts into business processes and maximizing ROI on retention.

## 📝 Business Context & Rationale

Every SaaS provider faces a core challenge: minimizing churn among valuable subscribers. Losing high-LTV customers is costly, yet targeting retention at low-risk customers wastes effort. This project begins with the real questions that matter to business leaders:
- Who is most likely to leave, and how do we spot them early?
- Which customer segments represent the greatest retention opportunity?
- How can predictive insights be operationalized—turning “churn risk” into efficient action?

## 📈 Key Analytical Steps

**1. Data Exploration & Cleaning:**
- Loaded, validated, and cleaned a SaaS dataset, representing thousands of real customer records from diverse regions and marketing channels.
- Segmented by [Region: LatAm, North America, Europe, etc.], [Acquisition Channel: Google Ads, Meta Ads, Organic Search, Outbound Sales], and [Tier: Basic, Pro, Enterprise].

**2. Drivers of Churn & Value:**
- Explored average ARPU, churn rates, gross margin, and LTV across segments—pinpointing who is most expensive to lose.
- Revealed that high-value Enterprise customers and LatAm markets are critical for SaaS growth.

**3. Churn Modeling for Decision-Making:**
- Built Random Forest and Logistic Regression models, using only interpretable and business-relevant features.
- Evaluated with precision-recall analysis, setting a threshold where retention campaigns catch >95% of churners with 79% precision. 
- Feature importance highlighted contract length and LTV as top drivers—long-term contracts are pivotal to retention.

**4. Segment-Based Churn Risk Analysis:**
- Used model predictions—not just historical averages—to flag at-risk regions and channels.
- Found highest predicted churn in LatAm (44%) and Google Ads (44%), impacting 679 and 1,736 customers, respectively.

## 📌 Business Insights & Recommendations

#### **Who to Target Right Now**

- **LatAm customers** and those acquired through **Google Ads** have the highest predicted churn risk. Retaining even 10% of these customers could have a significant impact on ARR.
- **Enterprise Tier**: These customers generate nearly 2x the lifetime value of others; a churn event here is substantially more costly.

#### **Why These Groups?**
- Short contract lengths and aggressive discounting were linked to higher churn, suggesting that longer-term plans and value retention messaging will improve results.
- Customers acquired via paid channel (Google Ads) show higher risk, likely due to onboarding and product/market fit issues.

#### **What Should the Business Do Next?**

- **Retention Campaigns**: Target proactive outreach, incentives, or success calls specifically to LatAm and Google Ads customers flagged by the model. 
- **Contract Strategy**: Encourage multi-year commitments for high-risk segments, using targeted discounting only when it aligns with LTV.
- **Operational Integration**: Deploy these model-based churn risk scores in the CRM for weekly customer health reviews, alerting the customer success team when risk spikes.

#### **Further Opportunities:**
- Integrate churn alerts with NPS surveys and usage analytics for richer insights.
- Test more advanced models (e.g., XGBoost) with additional behavioral features.
